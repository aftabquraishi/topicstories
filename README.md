# topicstories
This is a public portal where people can create topics and add content to it. This serves like a news portal or like the wikipedia but with more control and contribution through public.

This is a start-up idea. It is about topics which are of interest. Each topic will have a story. A story is a series of texts, images, videos, links, arranged in the order on the date it was added. Anyone can create a new topic story, and anyone can add text, image or video to it. By default latest item showed first. So, when people revisit the story they only see the latest content. If someone is totally new to the story, he or she can reverse the order of the story, he or she will be able to read it from the beginning. When someone tries to start a topic, all possible duplicates are shown to avoid recreating the same topic. If the topic is still created, later people can mark it as duplicate and close it. Also, story content order can be changed later based on moderation. People will have points and badges to get their rank. Higher ranked people will have higher privileges to edit or moderate the content, much like stack overflow. To maintain the content quality and focus of the site, topics should be very precise and must not be duplicated. And people should be able to moderate the topic properly so that the story is in a proper sequence and the content is of top quality.

Topics must be chosen in a very precise way to allow the community or the system to be able to manage the content. Topics must be specific and not too general. This will probably depend on the judgement of the moderators. For example: cricket is a too general of a topic, world cup is little more specific, cricket world cup 2019 is more specific. Probably a story can have a fixed maximum size, say for example 1000 items. Content has to be within this limit and has to be reorganized or reformed to enhance the quality. And, due to the size restriction it cannot grow too large or becomes impossible for anyone to be able to read it in a proper way. What can be done is, topics can be interrelated to each other. So, it looks like it will be more like the wikipedia, but the difference is, it can be managed with lesser effort, no need of lots of writing, it will contain lots of images and videos, which is lots of fun, it will not host anything other than texts or links, images and videos will be loaded from external sites.

People will tag a content for a location, for example a city or country. This is how a story can be localized.

A topic can have a number of parent or children topics. A viewer can browse through topics. This way topics can be in a granular format and a big topic can be accomodated. Big topics are like US election, FIFA world cup, Second world war. But after a certain size it may be very difficult to organize the topics in a meaningful way. This might be the biggest challenge of the site. Some topics will be controversial or illegal, like, politics, religion, porn etc. So, it must be regulated to benefit the humanity and the consumer base in a proper way.

Overall it will be like a media site but will evolve as more like wikipedia. Kind of replacement of regular news sites. Only difference is, content will grow up very fast and due to the dynamic behavior of content moderating quality will be higher and people will be able to find all content in one place, all chained together. This will be next generation news site.

Example local topics are: shagor runey murder, paypal in bangladesh, apon jewellers son scandal, bangladesh bank money hacking, zia orphanage trust case, dhaka second most polluted city, holy artisan attack, foodiez events.

Example international topics: FIFA world cup, Second world war, facebook.

Challenges:
- What will the limit of the content size, by number of content?
- Will there be sub stories?
- Will there be related stories? If so how they will be arranged?
- How to control controversy?
